# Project: API

## Overview
I chose the [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). This API provides a trend of CO2 emissions related to electricity only in the UK. The demand and generation by fuel type (gas, coal, wind, nuclear, solar) for each region is a forecast which updates every 30-min.

## Challenge

The main challenge was to put together the raw data from the API web. It was a demanding task as I had to do several 'for's to unravel the information. In addittion, I managed to keep the info request from all 17 regions of the UK.
