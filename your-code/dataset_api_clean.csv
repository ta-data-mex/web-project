## Historical Cryptocurrency Prices For ALL Tokens!

### **Summary**
	&gt; Observations: 758,534
	&gt; Variables: 13

### **Description**
   All historic open, high, low, close, trading volume and market cap info for all cryptocurrencies.  

   I've had to go over the code with a fine tooth comb to get it compatible with CRAN so there have been significant enhancements to how some of the field conversions have been undertaken and the data being cleaned. This should eliminate a few issues around number formatting or unexpected handling of scientific notations.

### Context

En aquest cas el context és detectar o preveure els diferents moviments que es produeixen per una serie factors, tant de moviment interns (compra-venda), com externs (moviments polítics, econòmics, etc...), en els principals índexs borsatils espanyols i de les crypto-monedes.

Hem seleccionat diferents fonts de dades per generar fitxers «csv», guardar diferents valors en el mateix període de temps. És important destacar que ens interessa més les tendències alcistes o baixes, que podem calcular o recuperar en aquests períodes de temps.

### Content

En aquest cas el contingut està format per diferents csv, especialment tenim els fitxers de moviments de cryptomoneda, els quals s’ha generat un fitxer per dia del període de temps estudiat.

Pel que fa als moviments del principals índexs borsatils s’ha generat una carpeta per dia del període, en cada directori un fitxer amb cadascun del noms dels índexs. Degut això s’han comprimit aquests últims abans de publicar-los en el directori de «open data» kaggle.com.

Pel que fa als camps, ens interessà detectar els moviments alcistes i baixistes, o almenys aquelles que tenen un patró similar en les cryptomonedes i els índexs. Els camps especialment destacats són:

    • Nom: Nom empresa o cryptomoneda;
    • Preu: Valor en euros d’una acció o una cryptomoneda;
    • Volum: En euros/volum 24 hores,acumulat de les transaccions diàries en milions d’euros
    • Simbol: Símbol o acrònim de la moneda
    • Cap de mercat: Valor total de totes les monedes en el moment actual
    • Oferta circulant: Valor en oportunitat de negoci
    • % 1h, % 2h i %7d, tant per cent del valor la moneda en 1h, 2h o 7d sobre la resta de cyprtomonedes.

7,Cryptocurrency Historical Prices,"Prices of top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash","### Context

Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and [this post][1] helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like:

1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?
2. Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? 

For getting answers to all these questions (and if possible to predict the future prices ;)), I started collecting data from [coinmarketcap][2] about the cryptocurrencies. 



So what next? 
Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to [Blockchain Info][3], I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.

This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.

### Inspiration

Some of the questions which could be inferred from this dataset are:

 1. How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time?
 2. Predicting the future price of the currencies
 3. Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?
 4. How does the price fluctuations of currencies correlate with each other?
 5. Seasonal trend in the price fluctuations

Bitcoin / Ethereum dataset could be used to look at the following:

 1. Factors affecting the bitcoin / ether price.
 2. Directional prediction of bitcoin / ether price. (refer [this paper][9] for more inspiration)
 3. Actual bitcoin price prediction.

Cryptocurrencies are fast becoming rivals to traditional currency across the world. The digital currencies are available to purchase in many different places, making it accessible to everyone, and with retailers accepting various cryptocurrencies it could be a sign that money as we know it is about to go through a major change.

In addition, the blockchain technology on which many cryptocurrencies are based, with its revolutionary distributed digital backbone, has many other promising applications. Implementations of secure, decentralized systems can aid us in conquering organizational issues of trust and security that have plagued our society throughout the ages. In effect, we can fundamentally disrupt industries core to economies, businesses and social structures, eliminating inefficiency and human error.

Recent growing interest in cryptocurrencies, specifically as a speculative investment vehicle, has sparked global conversation over the past 12 months. Although this data is available across various sites, there is a lack of understanding as to what is driving the exponential rise of many individual currencies. This data set is intended to be a starting point for a detailed analysis into what is driving price action, and what can be done to predict future movement.

For the past few months I have been searching for a reliable source for historical price information related to cryptocurrencies. I wasn't able to find anything that I could use to my liking, so I built my own data set.

I've written a small script that scrapes historical price information for the top 200 coins by market cap as listed on CoinMarketCap.com.

I plan to run some basic analysis on it to answer questions that I have a ""gut"" feeling about, but no quantitative evidence (yet!).

Questions such as: 

 - What is the correlation between bitcoin and alt coin prices?
 - What is the average age of the top 10 coins by market cap?
 - What day of the week is best to buy/sell?
 - Which coins in the top two hundred are less than 6 months old?
 - Which currencies are the most volatile? 
 - What the hell happens when we go to bed and Asia starts trading?

Feel free to use this for your own purposes! I just ask that you share your results with the group when complete.

16,Ethereum Blockchain,Complete live historical Ethereum blockchain data (BigQuery),"## Context

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have captured the imagination of technologists, financiers, and economists. Digital currencies are only one application of the underlying blockchain technology. Like its predecessor, Bitcoin, the [Ethereum][1] blockchain can be described as an immutable distributed ledger. However, creator Vitalik Buterin also extended the set of capabilities by including a virtual machine that can execute arbitrary code stored on the blockchain as smart contracts.

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are essentially [OLTP][2] databases, and provide little in the way of [OLAP][3] (analytics) functionality. However the Ethereum dataset is notably distinct from the Bitcoin dataset:

* The Ethereum blockchain has as its primary unit of value Ether, while the Bitcoin blockchain has Bitcoin. However, the majority of value transfer on the Ethereum blockchain is composed of so-called tokens. Tokens are created and managed by smart contracts.

* Ether value transfers are precise and direct, resembling accounting ledger debits and credits. This is in contrast to the Bitcoin value transfer mechanism, for which it can be difficult to determine the balance of a given wallet address.

* Addresses can be not only wallets that hold balances, but can also contain smart contract bytecode that allows the programmatic creation of agreements and automatic triggering of their execution.  An aggregate of coordinated smart contracts could be used to build a [decentralized autonomous organization][4].

## Content

The Ethereum blockchain data are now available for exploration with BigQuery. All historical data are in the [`ethereum_blockchain dataset`][5], which updates daily.

Our hope is that by making the data on public blockchain systems more readily available it promotes technological innovation and increases societal benefits.

## Querying BigQuery tables

You can use the BigQuery Python client library to query tables in this dataset in Kernels. Note that methods available in Kernels are limited to querying data. Tables are at `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.[TABLENAME]`. **[Fork this kernel to get started][6]**.

### Content

Exchange rates are defined as the price of one country's' currency in relation to another. Exchange rates may be expressed as the average rate for a period of time or as the rate at the end of the period. Exchange rates are classified by the International Monetary Fund in three broad categories, reflecting the role of the authorities in the determination of the exchange rates and/or the multiplicity of exchange rates in a country: the market rate, in which the rate ""floats"" and is largely set by market forces; the official rate, in which the rate is ""fixed"" by a country's authorities; and arrangements falling between the two, in which the rate holds a stable value against another currency or a composite of currencies. This indicator is measured in terms of national currency per US dollar.

26,401 crypto currency pairs at 1-minute resolution,Historical crypto currency data from the Bitfinex exchange including Bitcoin,"## About this dataset

With the rise of crypto currency markets the interest in creating automated trading strategies, or trading bots, has grown. Developing algorithmic trading strategies however requires intensive backtesting to ensure profitable performance. It follows that access to high resolution historical trading data is the foundation of every successful  algorithmic trading strategy. This dataset therefore provides open, high, low, close (OHLC) data at 1 minute resolution of various crypto currency pairs for the development of automated trading systems.

### Content

This dataset contains the historical trading data (OHLC) of 401 trading pairs at 1 minute resolution reaching back until the year 2013. It was collected from the Bitfinex exchange as described in [this article](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-to-get-historical-crypto-currency-data-954062d40d2d).
The data in the CSV files is the raw output of the Bitfinex API. This means that there are no timestamps for time periods in which the exchange was down. Also if there were time periods without any activity or trades there will be no timestamp as well. 

### Inspiration

This dataset is intended to facilitate the development of automatic trading strategies. Machine learning algorithms, as they are available through various open source libraries these days, typically require large amounts of training data to unveil their full power. Also the process of backtesting new strategies before deploying them rests on high quality data. Most crypto trading datasets that are currently available either have low temporal resolution, are not free of charge or focus only on a limited number of currency pairs. This dataset on the other hand provides high temporal resolution data of almost 400 currency pairs for the development of new trading algorithms.",2019-07-09T21:25:22.227Z,tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution,393.638972,https://www.kaggle.com/tencars/392-crypto-currency-pairs-at-minute-resolution,3,119,CC BY-SA 4.0,2,"Ready version: 2, 2019-07-09T21:25:22.227Z",1.0,currency

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus ""chained"" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred. As with any currency/commodity on the market, bitcoin trading and financial instruments soon followed public adoption of bitcoin and continue to grow. Included here is historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for select bitcoin exchanges where trading takes place. Happy (data) mining!

Timestamps without any trades or activity have their data fields filled with NaNs.** If a timestamp is missing, or if there are jumps, this may be because the exchange (or its API) was down, the exchange (or its API) did not exist, or some other unforseen technical error in data reporting or gathering.

32,Kickstarter Project Statistics,4000 live projects plus 4000 most backed projects,"Crowdfunding has become one of the main sources of initial capital for small businesses and start-up companies that are looking to launch their first products. Websites like [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com) and [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/) provide a platform for millions of creators to present their innovative ideas to the public. This is a win-win situation where creators could accumulate initial fund while the public get access to cutting-edge prototypical products that are not available in the market yet.

At any given point, Indiegogo has around 10,000 live campaigns while Kickstarter has 6,000. It has become increasingly difficult for projects to stand out of the crowd. Of course, advertisements via various channels are by far the most important factor to a successful campaign. However, for creators with a smaller budget, this leaves them wonder,

**""How do we increase the probability of success of our campaign starting from the very moment we create our project on these websites?""**

35,Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey 2017,A big picture view of the state of data science and machine learning.,"### Context

For the first time, Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey received over 16,000 responses and we learned a ton about who is working with data, what’s happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field.

To share some of the initial insights from the survey, we’ve worked with the folks from [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) to put together [this interactive report](https://kaggle.com/surveys/2017). They’ve shared all of the kernels used in the report [here](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results).

### Content

The data includes 5 files: 

  - `schema.csv`: a CSV file with survey schema. This schema includes the questions that correspond to each column name in both the `multipleChoiceResponses.csv` and `freeformResponses.csv`.
  - `multipleChoiceResponses.csv`: Respondents' answers to multiple choice and ranking questions. These are non-randomized and thus a single row does correspond to all of a single user's answers.
  -`freeformResponses.csv`: Respondents' freeform answers to Kaggle's survey questions. These responses are randomized within a column, so that reading across a single row does not give a single user's answers.
  - `conversionRates.csv`: Currency conversion rates (to USD) as accessed from the R package ""quantmod"" on September 14, 2017
  - `RespondentTypeREADME.txt`: This is a schema for decoding the responses in the ""Asked"" column of the `schema.csv` file.

### Kernel Awards in November
In the month of November, we’re awarding $1000 a week for code and analyses shared on this dataset via [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017/kernels). Read more about this month’s [Kaggle Kernels Awards](https://www.kaggle.com/about/datasets-awards/kernels) and help us advance the state of machine learning and data science by exploring this one of a kind dataset.

### Methodology
  - This survey received 16,716 usable respondents from 171 countries and territories. If a country or territory received less than 50 respondents, we grouped them into a group named “Other” for anonymity.
  - We excluded respondents who were flagged by our survey system as “Spam” or who did not answer the question regarding their employment status (this question was the first required question, so not answering it indicates that the respondent did not proceed past the 5th question in our survey).
  - Most of our respondents were found primarily through Kaggle channels, like our email list, discussion forums and social media channels.
  - The survey was live from August 7th to August 25th. The median response time for those who participated in the survey was 16.4 minutes. We allowed respondents to complete the survey at any time during that window.
  - We received salary data by first asking respondents for their day-to-day currency, and then asking them to write in either their total compensation.
     - We’ve provided a csv with an exchange rate to USD for you to calculate the salary in US dollars on your own.
     - The question was optional
  - Not every question was shown to every respondent. In an attempt to ask relevant questions to each respondent, we generally asked work related questions to employed data scientists and learning related questions to students. There is a column in the `schema.csv` file called ""Asked"" that describes who saw each question. You can learn more about the different segments we used in the `schema.csv` file and `RespondentTypeREADME.txt` in the data tab.
  - To protect the respondents’ identity, the answers to multiple choice questions have been separated into a separate data file from the open-ended responses. We do not provide a key to match up the multiple choice and free form responses. Further, the free form responses have been randomized column-wise such that the responses that appear on the same row did not necessarily come from the same survey-taker.

38,Demonetization in India,Withdrawal of  500 and 1000 bills in India,"Withdrawal of a particular form of currency (such a gold coins, currency notes) from circulation is known as demonetization .
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context:** 

On November 8th, India’s Prime Minister  announced that 86% of the country’s currency would be rendered null and void in 50 days and it will withdraw all 500 and 1,000 rupee notes — the country’s most popular currency denominations from circulation, while a new 2,000 rupee note added in.  It was posited as a move to crackdown on corruption and the country’s booming under-regulated and virtually untaxed grassroots economy.

    The economic calendar is an indispensable assistant for the trader.

Data set
--------

   The data set is created in the form of an CSV, Excel spreadsheet (two files 2011-2013, 2014-2019), which can be found at boot time. You can see the source of the data on the site https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/

![http://comparic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Economic_Calendar_-_Investing.com_-_2016-12-19_02.45.10.jpg][1]

1. column - Event date
2. column - Event time (time New York)
3. column - Country of the event
4. column - The degree of volatility (possible fluctuations in currency, indices, etc.) caused by this event
5. column - Description of the event
6. column - Evaluation of the event according to the actual data, which came out better than the forecast, worse or correspond to it

Inspiration
-------------

 1. Use the historical EU in conjunction with the Forex data (exchange rates, indices, metals, oil, stocks) to forecast subsequent Forex data in order to minimize investment risks (combine fundamental market analysis and technical).
 2. Historical events of the EU used as a forecast of the subsequent (for example, the calculation of the probability of an increase in the rate of the Fed).
 3. Investigate the impact of combinations of EC events on the degree of market volatility at different time periods.
 4. To trace the main trends in the economies of the leading countries (for example, a decrease in the demand for unemployment benefits).
 5. Use the EU calendar together with the news background archive for this time interval for a more accurate forecast.

71,NYC Property Sales,A year's worth of properties sold on the NYC real estate market,"### Context

This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.

### Content

This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:

* `BOROUGH`: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).
* `BLOCK`; `LOT`: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a `BBL`.
* `BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT` and `BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE`: The type of building at various points in time. See the glossary linked to below.

For further reference on individual fields see the [Glossary of Terms](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/07pdf/glossary_rsf071607.pdf). For the building classification codes see the [Building Classifications Glossary](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/jump/hlpbldgcode.html).

Note that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:

* Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.
* This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.

73,New York Stock Exchange,S&P 500 companies historical prices with fundamental data,"# Context 

This dataset is a playground for fundamental and  technical analysis. It is said that 30% of traffic on stocks is already generated by machines, can trading be fully automated? If not, there is still a lot to learn from historical data.    

# Content

Dataset consists of following files:

 - **prices.csv**: raw, as-is daily prices. Most of data spans from 2010 to the end 2016, for companies new on stock market date range is shorter. There have been approx. 140 stock splits in that time, this set doesn't account for that.
 - **prices-split-adjusted.csv**: same as prices, but there have been added adjustments for splits.
 - **securities.csv**: general description of each company with division on sectors
 - **fundamentals.csv**: metrics extracted from annual SEC 10K fillings (2012-2016), should be enough to derive most of popular fundamental indicators.

# Acknowledgements

Prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance, fundamentals are from Nasdaq Financials, extended by some fields from EDGAR SEC databases.

# Inspiration

Here is couple of things one could try out with this data:

 - One day ahead prediction: Rolling Linear Regression, ARIMA, Neural Networks, LSTM
 - Momentum/Mean-Reversion Strategies
 - Security clustering, portfolio construction/hedging

Bitcoin is the longest running and most well known cryptocurrency, first released as open source in 2009 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin serves as a decentralized medium of digital exchange, with transactions verified and recorded in a public distributed ledger (the blockchain) without the need for a trusted record keeping authority or central intermediary. Transaction blocks contain a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of previous transaction blocks, and are thus ""chained"" together, serving as an immutable record of all transactions that have ever occurred.

77,Credit Card Fraud Detection,Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine,"Context
---------

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

Content
---------

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. 

Inspiration
---------

Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.

78,Daily News for Stock Market Prediction,Using 8 years daily news headlines to predict stock market movement,"Actually, I prepare this dataset for students on my Deep Learning and NLP course. 

But I am also very happy to see kagglers play around with it.

Have fun!

**Description:**

There are two channels of data provided in this dataset:

1. News data: I crawled historical news headlines from [Reddit WorldNews Channel][1] (/r/worldnews). They are ranked by reddit users' votes, and only the top 25 headlines are considered for a single date.
(Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01)

2. Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to ""prove the concept"".
(Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)

I provided three data files in *.csv* format:

1. **RedditNews.csv**: two columns
The first column is the ""date"", and second column is the ""news headlines"".
All news are ranked from top to bottom based on how *hot* they are.
Hence, there are 25 lines for each date.

2. **DJIA_table.csv**: 
Downloaded directly from [Yahoo Finance][2]: check out the web page for more info.

3. **Combined_News_DJIA.csv**:
To make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns.
The first column is ""Date"", the second is ""Label"", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from ""Top1"" to ""Top25"".

**=========================================**

*To my students:*

*I made this a binary classification task. Hence, there are only two labels:*

*""1"" when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same;*

*""0"" when DJIA Adj Close value decreased.*

*For task evaluation, please use data from 2008-08-08 to 2014-12-31 as Training Set, and Test Set is then the following two years data (from 2015-01-02 to 2016-07-01). This is roughly a 80%/20% split.*

*And, of course, use AUC as the evaluation metric.*

**=========================================**

**+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**

*To all kagglers:*

*Please upvote this dataset if you like this idea for market prediction.*

*If you think you coded an amazing trading algorithm,*

*friendly advice* 

*do play safe with your own money :)*

**+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**

83,Cryptocurrency Historical Prices,"Prices of top cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin cash","### Context

Things like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about it and [this post][1] helped me get started. Once the basics are done, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like:

1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations?
2. Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? 

For getting answers to all these questions (and if possible to predict the future prices ;)), I started collecting data from [coinmarketcap][2] about the cryptocurrencies. 



So what next? 
Now that we have the price data, I wanted to dig a little more about the factors affecting the price of coins. I started of with Bitcoin and there are quite a few parameters which affect the price of Bitcoin. Thanks to [Blockchain Info][3], I was able to get quite a few parameters on once in two day basis.

This will help understand the other factors related to Bitcoin price and also help one make future predictions in a better way than just using the historical price.

### Inspiration

Some of the questions which could be inferred from this dataset are:

 1. How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time?
 2. Predicting the future price of the currencies
 3. Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable?
 4. How does the price fluctuations of currencies correlate with each other?
 5. Seasonal trend in the price fluctuations

Bitcoin / Ethereum dataset could be used to look at the following:

 1. Factors affecting the bitcoin / ether price.
 2. Directional prediction of bitcoin / ether price. (refer [this paper][9] for more inspiration)
 3. Actual bitcoin price prediction.

###Disclaimer
This dataset contains **almost** all the stocks listed on these exchanges as of the date shown in the file name. Some of the symbols cannot be found on Yahoo Finance, which I plan on using CNN Money to scrape. There are other symbols that have different classes that require some modification before I can make them queryable... I have yet to decide on the best course of action. If you want to know what these excluded symbols are, see excluded_symbols.txt.

Note: there used to be some tickers missing because of poor connection, that's been solved now.

**I've also been asked why I don't put everything into one table, and here's my rationale (copy/pasted from my email):**

It is possible and I've debated this before, but I've decided to go with individual files for quite a number of reasons, and I highly recommend you consider these before combining them:
1) I don't need to load everything into memory or search for the right rows if I only want to work with particular sets,
2) easier and faster to manipulate (append, remove, or whatever) when all the data of a ticker is in the same place,
3) I don't need to repeat ticker names for each row just to know which row belongs to which ticker,
4) reduce risk, latency, and waits during parallel processing of different ticker data,
5) in case of any unforeseen bad writes or termination, this way reduces the chances of affecting the entire dataset and allows for restart anytime without the need to keep backup things up every 5 minutes.
I get all these benefits only at the cost of slightly larger compressed file and a few more lines of code. To me it's worth it, but I can understand if you are frustrated, but it is possible to concatenate everything.

88,Enrico's Email Flows,"Anonymized Metadata (i.e. sender, receivers, date) from my 2005-2018 Archives","### Context

Email archives are a great source of information about the real-world social networks people are generally most involved in. Although sharing of full email exchanges is almost never a good idea, flow metadata (i.e. who sent a message to whom, and when) can be **anonymized** quite effectively and still carry a lot of information.

I'm sharing over 10 years of flow metadata from my work and personal email accounts to enable data scientists experiment with their favourite statistics and social network analysis tools. A getting-started notebook is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/emarock/getting-started-with-email-flows).

For anyone willing to extract similar datasets from their own email accounts, the tool I put together for producing mine is available at [https://github.com/emarock/mailfix](https://github.com/emarock/mailfix) (currently supports extraction from Gmail accounts, IMAP accounts and Apple Mail on macOS).


### Content

This dataset contains two files:

 - `work.csv`: email flow metadata from my work account (~146,000 emails, from 2005 to 2018)
 - `personal.csv`: email flow metadata from my personal account (~41,000 emails, from 2006 to 2018)

As one should expect from any decade long archive, the data presents some partial corruptions and anomalies, that are however time-confined and should be easily identified and filtered out through basic statistical analysis. I will be happy to discuss and provide more information in the comments.


### Inspiration

Basic exploration:

 - Who am I?
 - Who's human and who's not? How different are attention-seekers from mailing list engines?
 - How did my communication patterns change over time? Did they change in the same way in and out of work?
 - Did my social network grow? Did it shrink?
 - Who's my boss? Who were my former ones? Who'll be the next one?

I will be also available to extend the dataset with additional data for training advanced classifiers (e.g. lists of actual humans, mailing lists, VIPs...). Feel free to ask in the comments.


### Anonymization and Privacy Note

The anonymization function (code [here](https://github.com/emarock/mailfix/blob/master/lib/anonymizer.js), tests [here](https://github.com/emarock/mailfix/blob/master/test/anonymizer.js)) is based on [djb2 string hashing](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html) and on a [Mersenne Twister pseudorandom generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister), implemented in the [string-hash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-hash) and [casual](https://www.npmjs.com/package/casual) node.js modules. It should be practically irreversible, modulo implementation defects.

However, if you've ever been involved in email exchanges with me, you can work your way back to the anonymized address associated to your actual address by comparing the message timestamps. Similarly, with a little more guesswork, you can discover the anonymized addresses of those who were also involved in those exchanges. Since that is also true for them in respect to you, if that is of any concern just reach out and I'll censor the problematic entries in the dataset.",2018-03-21T10:10:40.373Z,emarock/enricos-email-flows,12.867137,https://www.kaggle.com/emarock/enricos-email-flows,3,84,CC0: Public Domain,1,"Ready version: 1, 2018-03-21T10:10:40.373Z",0.882352948,exchanges

93,Russian Troll Tweets,"200,000 malicious-account tweets captured by NBC","### Context

As part of the House Intelligence Committee investigation into how Russia may have influenced the 2016 US Election, Twitter released the screen names of almost 3000 Twitter accounts believed to be connected to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, a company known for operating social media troll accounts. Twitter immediately suspended these accounts, deleting their data from Twitter.com and the Twitter API. A team at NBC News including Ben Popken and EJ Fox was able to reconstruct a dataset consisting of a subset of the deleted data for their investigation and were able to show how these troll accounts went on attack during key election moments. This dataset is the body of this open-sourced reconstruction.

For more background, read the NBC news article publicizing the release: [""Twitter deleted 200,000 Russian troll tweets. Read them here.""](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731)

### Content

This dataset contains two CSV files. `tweets.csv` includes details on individual tweets, while `users.csv` includes details on individual accounts.

To recreate a link to an individual tweet found in the dataset, replace `user_key` in `https://twitter.com/user_key/status/tweet_id` with the screen-name from the `user_key` field and `tweet_id` with the number in the `tweet_id` field.

Following the links will lead to a suspended page on Twitter. But some copies of the tweets as they originally appeared, including images, can be found by entering the links on web caches like `archive.org` and `archive.is`.

94,Financial Tweets,"Tweets from verified users concerning stocks traded on the NYSE, NASDAQ, & SNP","### Context
I have been interested in using public sentiment and journalism to gather sentiment profiles on publicly traded companies. I first developed a Python package (https://github.com/dwallach1/Stocker) that scrapes the web for articles written about companies, and then noticed the abundance of overlap with Twitter. I then developed a NodeJS project that I have been running on my RaspberryPi to monitor Twitter for all tweets coming from those mentioned in the *content* section. If one of them tweeted about a company in the stocks_cleaned.csv file, then it would write the tweet to the database. Currently, the file is only from earlier today, but after about a month or two, I plan to update the tweets.csv file (hopefully closer to 50,000 entries. 

I am not quite sure how this dataset will be relevant, but I hope to use these tweets and try to generate some sense of public sentiment score.  


### Content

This dataset has all the publicly traded companies (tickers and company names) that were used as input to fill the tweets.csv. The influencers whose tweets were monitored were:

During the 2019 Australian election I noticed that almost everything I was seeing on Twitter was unusually left-wing. So I decided to scrape some data and investigate. Unfortunately my sentiment analysis has so far been too inaccurate to come to any useful conclusions. I decided to share the data so that others may be able to help with the sentiment or any other interesting analysis.


### Content

Over 180,000 tweets collected using Twitter API keyword search between 10.05.2019 and 20.05.2019.
Columns are as follows:

- **created_at**: Date and time of tweet creation
- **id**: Unique ID of the tweet
- **full_text**: Full tweet text
- **retweet_count**: Number of retweets
- **favorite_count**: Number of likes
- **user_id**: User ID of tweet creator
- **user_name**: Username of tweet creator
- **user_screen_name**: Screen name of tweet creator
- **user_description**: Description on tweet creator's profile
- **user_location**: Location given on tweet creator's profile
- **user_created_at**: Date the tweet creator joined Twitter  

The **latitude** and **longitude** of **user_location** is also available in location_geocode.csv. This information was retrieved using the Google Geocode API. 

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Twitter for providing the free API.


### Inspiration

There are a lot of interesting things that could be investigated with this data. Primarily I was interested to do sentiment analysis, before and after the election results were known, to determine whether Twitter users are indeed a left-leaning bunch. Did the tweets become more negative as the results were known?

Other ideas for investigation include:

- Take into account retweets and favourites to weight overall sentiment analysis.

- Which parts of the world are interested (ie: tweet about) the Australian elections, apart from Australia?

- How do the users who tweet about this sort of thing tend to describe themselves?

- Is there a correlation between when the user joined Twitter and their political views (this assumes the sentiment analysis is already working well)?

This new set contains 122k tweets collected on two separate days, 7/4/2016 and 7/11/2016, which contained any of the following terms, with no further editing or selection:

 - isis 
 - isil 
 - daesh 
 - islamicstate 
 - raqqa 
 - Mosul
 - ""islamic state""

This is not a perfect counterpoise as it almost surely contains a small number of pro-Isis fanboy tweets.  However, unless some entity, such as Kaggle, is willing to expend significant resources on a service something like an expert level Mechanical Turk or Zooniverse, a high quality counterpoise is out of reach.  

A counterpoise provides a balance or backdrop against which to measure a primary object, in this case the original pro-Isis data. So if anyone wants to discriminate between pro-Isis tweets and other tweets concerning Isis you will need to model the original pro-Isis data or **signal** against the counterpoise which is  **signal + noise**.  Further background and some analysis can be found in [this forum thread][3].

This data comes from postmodernnews.com/token-tv.aspx which daily collects about 25MB of Isis tweets for the purposes of graphical display. PLEASE NOTE: This server is not currently active.

Data Details
------------

There are several differences between the format of this data set and the pro-ISIS fanboy [dataset][4].
 1. All the twitter t.co tags have been expanded where possible
 2. There are no ""description, location, followers, numberstatuses"" data columns.   

I have also included my version of the original pro-ISIS fanboy set.  This version has all the t.co links expanded where possible.

98,Democrat Vs. Republican Tweets,200 tweets of Dems and Reps,"### Context

Twitter give the general public unfiltered direct access to the ideas and policies of politicians. This means that understanding the content and reach of these tweets can help us understand what connects with constituents. This dataset is meant to help with that exploration. By applying sentiment analysis (using an already trained system) we can apply sentiment context to these tweets. This will help us understand who responds to positive and negative content. Finally this analysis may help to indentify fake or hyperbole polarized Twitter users. 


### Content

The dataset contains two files both in .csv format.  The first is a list of the political party and the representative handles, and the second are the 200 latest tweets as of May 2018 from those twitter users.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the following website and people who helped me get started

### Inspiration

I was first inspired by trying to find out if the average person would be able to distinguish between political tweets of no context was given. I made a small website that you can try this on. I will use real user data to cross check and see if ML methods are actually better than the average person. 

Other ace uses are the following:
Can we use this to detect Russian troll twitter accounts?
Do people respond to negative or positive political tweets?

100,Election Day Tweets,"Tweets scraped from Twitter on November 8, 2016","Tweets scraped by [Chris Albon](https://github.com/chrisalbon) on the day of the 2016 United States elections.

Chris Albon's site only posted tweet IDs, rather than full tweets. We're in the process of scraping the full information, but due to API limiting this is taking a very long time. Version 1 of this dataset contains just under 400k tweets, about 6% of the 6.5 million originally posted.

This dataset will be updated as more tweets become available.

## Acknowledgements

[The original data](https://github.com/chrisalbon/election_day_2016_twitter) was scraped by [Chris Albon](https://github.com/chrisalbon), and tweet IDs were posted to his Github page.

## The Data

Since I (Ed King) used my own Twitter API key to scrape these tweets, this dataset contains a couple of fields with information on whether I have personally interacted with particular users or tweets. Since Kaggle encouraged me to not remove any data from a dataset, I'm leaving it in; feel free to build a classifier of the types of users I follow.

The dataset consists of the following fields:

- **text**: text of the tweet
- **created_at**: date and time of the tweet
- **geo**: a JSON object containing coordinates [latitude, longitude] and a `type'
- **lang**: Twitter's guess as to the language of the tweet
- **place**: a Place object from the Twitter API
- **coordinates**: a JSON object containing coordinates [longitude, latitude] and a `type'; **note** that coordinates are reversed from the **geo** field
- **user.favourites_count**: number of tweets the user has favorited
- **user.statuses_count**: number of statuses the user has posted
- **user.description**: the text of the user's profile description
- **user.location**: text of the user's profile location
- **user.id**: unique id for the user
- **user.created_at**: when the user created their account
- **user.verified**: bool; is user verified?
- **user.following**: bool; am I (Ed King) following this user?
- **user.url**: the URL that the user listed in their profile (not necessarily a link to their Twitter profile)
- **user.listed_count**: number of lists this user is on (?)
- **user.followers_count**: number of accounts that follow this user
- **user.default_profile_image**: bool; does the user use the default profile pic?
- **user.utc_offset**: positive or negative distance from UTC, in seconds
- **user.friends_count**: number of accounts this user follows
- **user.default_profile**: bool; does the user use the default profile?
- **user.name**: user's profile name
- **user.lang**: user's default language
- **user.screen_name**: user's account name
- **user.geo_enabled**: bool; does user have geo enabled?
- **user.profile_background_color**: user's profile background color, as hex in format ""RRGGBB"" (no '#')
- **user.profile_image_url**: a link to the user's profile pic
- **user.time_zone**: full name of the user's time zone
- **id**: unique tweet ID
- **favorite_count**: number of times the tweet has been favorited
- **retweeted**: is this a retweet?
- **source**: if a link, where is it from (e.g., ""Instagram"")
- **favorited**: have I (Ed King) favorited this tweet?
- **retweet_count**: number of times this tweet has been retweeted


I've also included a file called ```bad_tweets.csv``` , which includes all of the tweet IDs that could not be scraped, along with the error message I received while trying to scrape them. This typically happens because the tweet has been deleted, the user has deleted their account (or been banned), or the user has made their tweets private.

101,Russian Troll Tweets,3 million tweets from accounts associated with the 'Internet Research Agency',"# 3 million Russian troll tweets

This data was used in the FiveThirtyEight story [Why We’re Sharing 3 Million Russian Troll Tweets](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/).

This directory contains data on nearly 3 million tweets sent from Twitter handles connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian ""troll factory"" and a defendant in [an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) filed by the Justice Department in February 2018, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. The tweets in this database were sent between February 2012 and May 2018, with the vast majority posted from 2015 through 2017.

FiveThirtyEight obtained the data from Clemson University researchers [Darren Linvill](https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/faculty-staff/profiles/darrenl), an associate professor of communication, and [Patrick Warren](http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/), an associate professor of economics, on July 25, 2018. They gathered the data using custom searches on a tool called Social Studio, owned by Salesforce and contracted for use by Clemson's [Social Media Listening Center](https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/centers-institutes/smlc/).

The basis for the Twitter handles included in this data are the [November 2017](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/exhibit_b.pdf) and [June 2018](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/ira_handles_june_2018.pdf) lists of Internet Research Agency-connected handles that Twitter [provided](https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=396) to Congress. This data set contains every tweet sent from each of the 2,752 handles on the November 2017 list since May 10, 2015. For the 946 handles newly added on the June 2018 list, this data contains every tweet since June 19, 2015. (For certain handles, the data extends even earlier than these ranges. Some of the listed handles did not tweet during these ranges.) The researchers believe that this includes the overwhelming majority of these handles’ activity. The researchers also removed 19 handles that remained on the June 2018 list but that they deemed very unlikely to be IRA trolls.

In total, the nine CSV files include 2,973,371 tweets from 2,848 Twitter handles. Also, as always, caveat emptor -- in this case, tweet-reader beware: In addition to their own content, some of the tweets contain active links, which may lead to adult content or worse.

The Clemson researchers used this data in a working paper, [Troll Factories: The Internet Research Agency and State-Sponsored Agenda Building](http://pwarren.people.clemson.edu/Linvill_Warren_TrollFactory.pdf), which is currently under review at an academic journal. The authors’ analysis in this paper was done on the data file provided here, limiting the date window to June 19, 2015, to Dec. 31, 2017.

The files have the following columns:

    Header | Definition
    ---|---------
    `external_author_id` | An author account ID from Twitter 
    `author` | The handle sending the tweet
    `content` | The text of the tweet
    `region` | A region classification, as [determined by Social Studio](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?   id=000199367&type=1)
    `language` | The language of the tweet
    `publish_date` | The date and time the tweet was sent
    `harvested_date` | The date and time the tweet was collected by Social Studio
    `following` | The number of accounts the handle was following at the time of the tweet
    `followers` | The number of followers the handle had at the time of the tweet
    `updates` | The number of “update actions” on the account that authored the tweet, including tweets, retweets and likes
    `post_type` | Indicates if the tweet was a retweet or a quote-tweet
    `account_type` | Specific account theme, as coded by Linvill and Warren
    `retweet` | A binary indicator of whether or not the tweet is a retweet
    `account_category` | General account theme, as coded by Linvill and Warren
    `new_june_2018` | A binary indicator of whether the handle was newly listed in June 2018

103,Good Morning Tweets,Tweets captured over ~24 hours with the text 'good morning' in them,"# Context 

It's possible, using R (and no doubt Python), to 'listen' to Twitter and capture tweets that match a certain description. I decided to test this out by grabbing tweets with the text 'good morning' in them over a 24 hours period, to see if you could see the world waking up from the location information and time-stamp. The main R package used was [streamR][1]


# Content

The tweets have been tidied up quite a bit. First, I've removed re-tweets, second, I've removed duplicates (not sure why Twitter gave me them in the first place), third, I've made sure the tweet contained the words 'good morning' (some tweets were returned that didn't have the text in for some reason) and fourth, I've removed all the tweets that didn't have a longitude and latitude included. This latter step removed the vast majority. What's left are various aspects of just under 5000 tweets. The columns are,

- text	
- retweet_count	
- favorited	
- truncated	
- id_str	
- in_reply_to_screen_name	
- source	
- retweeted	
- created_at

Nike just announced its partnership with Colin Kaepernick to be the face of the 30th anniversary of its **JustDoIt** campaign.   
They used the slogan ""Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.""  
Kaepernick had made a controversial decision not to stand up during the national anthem, as a protest to police brutality, a while back.  
This has stirred a heated debate, and became a big national issue especially when [Donald Trump commented on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY3hpZVZ7pk).


### Content

This dataset contains 5,000 tweets that contain the hashtag #JustDoIt.   
All tweets happened on September 7, 2018, which is days after Nike made its announcement to endorse Kaepernick.

------------
The FIFA World Cup (often simply called the World Cup ),  being the most prestigious association football tournament, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, was one of the Top Trending topics frequently on Twitter while ongoing.&nbsp;<br> <br>
This dataset contains a random collection of 530k tweets starting from the Round of 16 till the World Cup Final that took place on 15 July, 2018 & was won by France<br>
A preliminary analysis from the data (till the Round of 16) is available at: <br>
[https://medium.com/@ritu_rg/nlp-text-visualization-twitter-sentiment-analysis-in-r-5ac22c778448][1]


**Content:**
------------
**Data Collection:**  <br>
The dataset was created using the Tweepy API, by streaming tweets from world-wide football fans before, during or after the matches.  <br> 
Tweepy is a Python API for accessing the Twitter API, that provides an easy-to-use interface for streaming real-time data from Twitter. More information related to this API can be found at: http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/ <br> <br>

**Data Pre-processing:**  <br>
The dataset includes English language tweets containing any references to FIFA or the World Cup. The collected tweets have been pre-processed to facilitate analysis , while trying to ensure that any information from the original tweets is not lost.&nbsp; <br>
- The original tweet has been stored in the column ""Orig_tweet"".&nbsp; <br>
- As part of pre-processing, using the ""BeautifulSoup"" & ""regex"" libraries in Python, the tweets have been cleaned off any nuances as required for natural language processing, such as website names, hashtags, user mentions, special characters, RTs, tabs, heading/trailing/multiple spaces, among others. <br>
- Words containing extensions such as n't 'll 're 've have been replaced with their proper English language counterparts. Duplicate tweets have been removed from the dataset. <br>
- The original Hashtags & User Mentions extracted during the above step have also been stored in separate columns. <br> <br>

**Data Storage:**  <br>
The collected tweets have been consolidated into a single dataset & shared as a Comma Separated Values file ""FIFA.csv"". <br>
Each tweet is uniquely identifiable by its ID, & characterized by the following attributes, per availability: <br>
- ""Lang"" - Language of the tweet <br>
- ""Date"" - When it was tweeted <br>
- ""Source"" - The device/medium where it was tweeted from <br>
- ""len"" - The length of the tweet <br>
- ""Orig_Tweet"" - The tweet in its original form <br>
- ""Tweet"" - The updated tweet after pre-processing <br>
- ""Likes"" - The number of likes received by the tweet (till the time the extraction was done) <br>
- ""RTs"" - The number of times the tweet was shared <br>
- ""Hashtags"" - The Hashtags found in the original tweet <br>
- ""UserMentionNames"" & ""UserMentionID"" -  Extracted from the original tweet <br> <br>

It also includes the following attributes about the person that the tweet is from: <br>
- ""Name"" & ""Place"" of the user <br>
- ""Followers"" - The number of followers that the user account has <br>
- ""Friends"" - The number of friends the user account has <br>

Tweets containing Hurricane Harvey from the morning of 8/25/2017. I hope to keep this updated if computer problems do not persist. 

***8/30 Update**
This update includes the most recent tweets tagged ""Tropical Storm Harvey"", which spans from 8/20 to 8/30 as well as the properly merged version of dataset including Tweets from when Harvey before it was downgraded back to a tropical storm. 


### Inspiration

What are the popular tweets?

Can we find popular news stories from this?

Can we identify people likely staying or leaving, and is there a difference in sentiment between the two groups?

Is it possible to predict popularity with respect to retweets, likes, and shares?",2017-09-09T17:40:57.633Z,dan195/hurricaneharvey,23.022262,https://www.kaggle.com/dan195/hurricaneharvey,2,655,CC0: Public Domain,3,"Ready version: 6, 2017-09-09T17:40:57.633Z",0.8235294,tweets

This dataset contains all stories and comments from Hacker News from its launch in 2006.  Each story contains a story id, the author that made the post, when it was written, and the number of points the story received. Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. In general, content that can be submitted is defined as ""anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"".

### Content

Each story contains a story ID, the author that made the post, when it was written, and the number of points the story received.

Please note that the text field includes profanity. All texts are the author’s own, do not necessarily reflect the positions of Kaggle or Hacker News, and are presented without endorsement.

## Querying BigQuery tables

You can use the BigQuery Python client library to query tables in this dataset in Kernels. Note that methods available in Kernels are limited to querying data. Tables are at `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.[TABLENAME]`. **Fork [this kernel][1] to get started**.

### Acknowledgements 

This dataset was kindly made publicly available by [Hacker News][2] under [the MIT license][3].

### Inspiration

 - Recent studies have found that many forums tend to be dominated by a
   very small fraction of users. Is this true of Hacker News?

 - Hacker News has received complaints that the site is biased towards Y
   Combinator startups. Do the data support this? 

 - Is the amount of coverage by Hacker News predictive of a startup’s
   success?

114,Getting Real about Fake News,Text & metadata from fake & biased news sources around the web,"The latest hot topic in the news is fake news and many are wondering what data scientists can do to detect it and stymie its viral spread. This dataset is only a first step in understanding and tackling this problem. It contains text and metadata scraped from 244 websites tagged as ""bullshit"" by the [BS Detector][2] Chrome Extension by [Daniel Sieradski][3]. 

**Warning**: I did not modify the list of news sources from the BS Detector so as not to introduce my (useless) layer of bias; I'm not an authority on fake news. There may be sources whose inclusion you disagree with. It's up to you to decide how to work with the data and how you might contribute to ""improving it"". The labels of ""bs"" and ""junksci"", etc. do not constitute capital ""t"" Truth. If there are other sources you would like to include, start a discussion. If there are sources you believe should not be included, start a discussion or write a kernel analyzing the data. Or take the data and do something else productive with it. Kaggle's choice to host this dataset is not meant to express any particular political affiliation or intent.

## Contents

The dataset contains text and metadata from 244 websites and represents 12,999 posts in total from the past 30 days. The data was pulled using the [webhose.io][4] API; because it's coming from their crawler, not all websites identified by the BS Detector are present in this dataset. Each website was labeled according to the BS Detector as documented here. Data sources that were missing a label were simply assigned a label of ""bs"". There are (ostensibly) no genuine, reliable, or trustworthy news sources represented in this dataset (so far), so don't trust anything you read.

## Fake news in the news

For inspiration, I've included some (presumably non-fake) recent stories covering fake news in the news. This is a sensitive, nuanced topic and if there are other resources you'd like to see included here, please leave a suggestion. From defining fake, biased, and misleading news in the first place to deciding how to take action (a blacklist is not a good answer), there's a lot of information to consider beyond what can be neatly arranged in a CSV file.

* [How Fake News Spreads (NYT)][6]

* [We Tracked Down A Fake-News Creator In The Suburbs. Here's What We Learned (NPR)][7]

* [Does Facebook Generate Over Half of its Revenue from Fake News? (Forbes)][8]

* [Fake News is Not the Only Problem (Points - Medium)][9]

* [Washington Post Disgracefully Promotes a McCarthyite Blacklist From a New, Hidden, and Very Shady Group (The Intercept)][10]

## Improvements

If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to contribute, please let me know. The most obvious extensions are to include data from ""real"" news sites and to address the bias in the current list. I'd be happy to include any contributions in future versions of the dataset.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Anthony][11] for pointing me to [Daniel Sieradski's BS Detector][12]. Thank you to Daniel Nouri for encouraging me to add a disclaimer to the dataset's page.

115,All the news,"143,000 articles from 15 American publications","NOTE: A larger version of this dataset is now available at [Components][1].

### Context

I wanted to see how articles clustered together if the articles were rendered into document-term matrices---would there be greater affinity among political affiliations, or medium, subject matter, etc. The data was scraped using BeautifulSoup and stored in Sqlite, but I've chopped it up into three separate CSVs here, because the entire Sqlite database came out to about 1.2 gb, beyond Kaggle's max.

The publications include the New York Times, Breitbart, CNN, Business Insider, the Atlantic, Fox News, Talking Points Memo, Buzzfeed News, National Review, New York Post, the Guardian, NPR, Reuters, Vox, and the Washington Post. Sampling wasn't quite scientific; I chose publications based on my familiarity of the domain and tried to get a range of political alignments, as well as a mix of print and digital publications. By count, the publications break down accordingly:

The data primarily falls between the years of 2016 and July 2017, although there is a not-insignificant number of articles from 2015, and a possibly insignificant number from before then.

### Content

**articles1.csv** - 50,000 news articles (Articles 1-50,000)

**articles2.csv** - 49,999 news articles (Articles 50,001-100,00)

**articles3.csv** - Articles 100,001+



### Acknowledgements

Thanks mostly go to the maesters of Stack Overflow. 

For each publication, I used archive.org to grab the past year-and-a-half of either home-page headlines or RSS feeds and ran those links through the scraper. That is, the articles are not the product of scraping an entire site, but rather their more prominently placed articles. For example, CNN's articles from 5/6/16 were what appeared on the homepage of CNN.com proper, not everything within the CNN.com domain. Vox's articles from 5/6/16 were everything that appeared in the Vox RSS reader. on 5/6/16, and so on. RSS readers are a breeze to scrape, and so I used them when possible, but not every publication uses them or makes them easy to find.


![enter image description here][2]

It's not entirely even---this was something of a collect-it-all approach, and some sites are more prolific than others, and some have data that maintains integrity after scraping more easily than others.

### Inspiration

Sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

### Inspiration

I look at this news dataset as a summarised historical record of noteworthy events in the globe from early-2003 to end-2017 with a more granular focus on Australia.

This includes the entire corpus of articles published by the ABC website in the given time range. 
With a volume of 200 articles per day and a good focus on international news, we can be fairly certain that every event of significance has been captured here.

Digging into the keywords, one can see all the important episodes shaping the last decade and how they evolved over time.
Ex: financial crisis, iraq war, multiple US elections, ecological disasters, terrorism, famous people, Australian crimes  etc.

**Description:**

There are two channels of data provided in this dataset:

1. News data: I crawled historical news headlines from [Reddit WorldNews Channel][1] (/r/worldnews). They are ranked by reddit users' votes, and only the top 25 headlines are considered for a single date.
(Range: 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01)

2. Stock data: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is used to ""prove the concept"".
(Range: 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01)

I provided three data files in *.csv* format:

1. **RedditNews.csv**: two columns
The first column is the ""date"", and second column is the ""news headlines"".
All news are ranked from top to bottom based on how *hot* they are.
Hence, there are 25 lines for each date.

2. **DJIA_table.csv**: 
Downloaded directly from [Yahoo Finance][2]: check out the web page for more info.

3. **Combined_News_DJIA.csv**:
To make things easier for my students, I provide this combined dataset with 27 columns.
The first column is ""Date"", the second is ""Label"", and the following ones are news headlines ranging from ""Top1"" to ""Top25"".

**=========================================**

*To my students:*

*I made this a binary classification task. Hence, there are only two labels:*

*""1"" when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same;*

*""0"" when DJIA Adj Close value decreased.*

*For task evaluation, please use data from 2008-08-08 to 2014-12-31 as Training Set, and Test Set is then the following two years data (from 2015-01-02 to 2016-07-01). This is roughly a 80%/20% split.*

*And, of course, use AUC as the evaluation metric.*

**=========================================**

**+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**

*To all kagglers:*

*Please upvote this dataset if you like this idea for market prediction.*

*If you think you coded an amazing trading algorithm,*

*friendly advice* 

*do play safe with your own money :)*

120,News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection,High quality dataset for the task of Sarcasm Detection,"#Context

Past studies in Sarcasm Detection mostly make use of Twitter datasets collected using hashtag based supervision but such datasets are noisy in terms of labels and language. Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.

To overcome the limitations related to noise in Twitter datasets, this **News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection** is collected from two news website. [*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and we collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). We collect real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines from [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/).

This new dataset has following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets:

* Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings.

* Furthermore, since the sole purpose of *TheOnion* is to publish sarcastic news, we get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets.

* Unlike tweets which are replies to other tweets, the news headlines we obtained are self-contained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements.

# Content
Each record consists of three attributes:

* ```is_sarcastic```: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0

* ```headline```: the headline of the news article

* ```article_link```: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data

# Further Details
General statistics of data, instructions on how to read the data in python, and basic exploratory analysis could be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection). A hybrid NN architecture trained on this dataset can be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/Sarcasm-Detection-using-NN).

# Inspiration

Can you identify sarcastic sentences? Can you distinguish between fake news and legitimate news?

# Reading the data
Following code snippet could be used to read the data:

import json

def parse_data(file):

    for l in open(file,'r'):

        yield json.loads(l)

    
data = list(parse_data('./Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset.json'))

121,News Headlines Of India,18 Years of headlines focusing on India,"### Context

This News Dataset is a persistent historical archive of noteable events in the Indian subcontinent from start-2001 to end-2018, recorded in real-time by the journalists of India. It contains approximately 2.9 million events published by Times of India.

A majority of the data is focusing on Indian local news including national, city level and entertainment.

Agency Website: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com

The individual events can be explored in detail via the archives section.

### Content

CSV Rows: 2,969,922

1. **publish_date**: Date of the article being published online in yyyyMMdd format

2. **headline_category**: Category of the headline, ascii, dot delimited, lowercase values

3. **headline_text**: Text of the Headline in English, only ascii characters

Start Date: 2001-01-01 End Date: 2018-12-31

See This Kernal for [Overview of Trends and Categories][1] 

### Inspiration



Times Group as a news agency, reaches out a very wide audience across Asia and drawfs every other agency in the quantity of English Articles published per day. 
Due to the heavy daily volume (avg. 650 articles) over multiple years, this data offers a deep insight into Indian society, its priorities, events, issues and talking points and how they have unfolded over time. 

It is possible to chop this dataset into a smaller piece for a more focused analysis, based on one or more facets. 

 - Time Range: Records during 2014 election, 2006 Mumbai Bombings
 - One or more Categories: like Mumbai, Movie Releases, ICC updates, Magazine, Middle East
 - One or more Keywords: like crime or ecology related words; names of political parties, celebrities, corporations.

### Acknowledgements

The headlines are extracted from several GB of raw HTML files using Jsoup, Java and Bash. The entire process takes 11 minutes.

This logic also : chooses the best worded headline for each article (longest one is usually picked) ; clusters about 17k categories to 200 large groups ; removes records where the date is ambiguous (9k cases) ; finally cleans the selected headline via a string 'domestication' function (which I use for any wild text from the internet).

The final categories are as per the latest sitemap.  Around 1.5k rare categories remain and these records (~20k) can be filtered out easily during analysis. The category is unknown for ~200k records.

122,NEWS SUMMARY,Generating short length descriptions of news articles.,"### Context

I am currently working on summarizing chat context where it helps an agent in understanding previous context quickly. It interests me to apply the deep learning models to existing datasets and how they perform on them. I believe news articles are rich in grammar and vocabulary which allows us to gain greater insights.


### Content

The dataset consists of 4515 examples and contains Author_name, Headlines, Url of Article, Short text, Complete Article. I gathered the summarized news from Inshorts and only scraped the news articles from Hindu, Indian times and Guardian.  Time period ranges from febrauary to august 2017.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the authors of Inshorts for their amazing work

### Inspiration

* Generating short length descriptions(headlines) from text(news articles).
* Summarizing large amount of information which can be represented in compressed space

###Purpose

When I was working on the summarization task I didn't find any open source data-sets to work on, I believe there are people just like me who are working on these tasks and I hope it helps them.

###Contributions

It will be really helpful if anyone found nice insights from this data and can share their work. Thankyou...!!!

It Contains the Heading of the particular Article, Its content and its date. The content also contains the place from where the statement or Article was published.

# Importance

This dataset can be used to detect main patterns between writing pattern of different types of articles. One more thing that can be extracted from it is that we could also detect the main locations from where the different types of articles originate.

# Improvements

Some Data Cleaning could still be done specially in the content area of the dataset. One more thing that could be done is that we could extract the locations from the content and make a separated table for it.

126,Hacker News Corpus,A subset of all Hacker News articles,"### Context

This dataset contains a randomized sample of roughly one quarter of all stories and comments from Hacker News from its launch in 2006. Hacker News is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, Y Combinator. In general, content that can be submitted is defined as ""anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity"".

### Content

Each story contains a story ID, the author that made the post, when it was written, and the number of points the story received.

Please note that the text field includes profanity. All texts are the author’s own, do not necessarily reflect the positions of Kaggle or Hacker News, and are presented without endorsement.

### Acknowledgements

This dataset was kindly made publicly available by [Hacker News][1] under [the MIT license][2].

### Inspiration

 - Recent studies have found that many forums tend to be dominated by a
   very small fraction of users. Is this true of Hacker News?

 - Hacker News has received complaints that the site is biased towards Y
   Combinator startups. Do the data support this? 

 - Is the amount of coverage by Hacker News predictive of a startup’s
   success?

While The Examiner was never praised for its quality, it consistently churned out 1000s of articles per day over several years. 

At their height in 2011, The Examiner was ranked highly in google search and had enormous shares on social media.
At one point it was the 10th largest site on mobile and was attracting 20 million unique visitors a month.

129,BBC News Summary,Extractive Summarization of BBC News Articles ,"### Context

Text summarization is a way to condense the large amount of information into a concise form by the process of selection of important information and discarding unimportant and redundant information. With the amount of textual information present in the world wide web the area of text summarization is becoming very important. The extractive summarization is the one where the exact sentences present in the document are used as summaries. The extractive summarization is simpler and is the general practice among the automatic text summarization researchers at the present time. Extractive summarization process involves giving scores to sentences using some method and then using the sentences that achieve highest scores as summaries. As the exact sentence present in the document is used the semantic factor can be ignored which results in generation of less calculation intensive summarization procedure. This kind of summary is generally completely unsupervised and language independent too. Although this kind of summary does its job in conveying the essential information it may not be necessarily smooth or fluent. Sometimes there can be almost no connection between adjacent sentences in the summary resulting in the text lacking in readability. 


### Content

This dataset for extractive text summarization has four hundred and seventeen political news articles of BBC from 2004 to 2005 in the News Articles folder. For each articles, five summaries are provided in the Summaries folder. The first clause of the text of articles is the respective title.

132,Getting Real about Fake News,Text & metadata from fake & biased news sources around the web,"The latest hot topic in the news is fake news and many are wondering what data scientists can do to detect it and stymie its viral spread. This dataset is only a first step in understanding and tackling this problem. It contains text and metadata scraped from 244 websites tagged as ""bullshit"" by the [BS Detector][2] Chrome Extension by [Daniel Sieradski][3]. 

**Warning**: I did not modify the list of news sources from the BS Detector so as not to introduce my (useless) layer of bias; I'm not an authority on fake news. There may be sources whose inclusion you disagree with. It's up to you to decide how to work with the data and how you might contribute to ""improving it"". The labels of ""bs"" and ""junksci"", etc. do not constitute capital ""t"" Truth. If there are other sources you would like to include, start a discussion. If there are sources you believe should not be included, start a discussion or write a kernel analyzing the data. Or take the data and do something else productive with it. Kaggle's choice to host this dataset is not meant to express any particular political affiliation or intent.

## Contents

The dataset contains text and metadata from 244 websites and represents 12,999 posts in total from the past 30 days. The data was pulled using the [webhose.io][4] API; because it's coming from their crawler, not all websites identified by the BS Detector are present in this dataset. Each website was labeled according to the BS Detector as documented here. Data sources that were missing a label were simply assigned a label of ""bs"". There are (ostensibly) no genuine, reliable, or trustworthy news sources represented in this dataset (so far), so don't trust anything you read.

## Fake news in the news

For inspiration, I've included some (presumably non-fake) recent stories covering fake news in the news. This is a sensitive, nuanced topic and if there are other resources you'd like to see included here, please leave a suggestion. From defining fake, biased, and misleading news in the first place to deciding how to take action (a blacklist is not a good answer), there's a lot of information to consider beyond what can be neatly arranged in a CSV file.

* [How Fake News Spreads (NYT)][6]

* [We Tracked Down A Fake-News Creator In The Suburbs. Here's What We Learned (NPR)][7]

* [Does Facebook Generate Over Half of its Revenue from Fake News? (Forbes)][8]

* [Fake News is Not the Only Problem (Points - Medium)][9]

* [Washington Post Disgracefully Promotes a McCarthyite Blacklist From a New, Hidden, and Very Shady Group (The Intercept)][10]

## Improvements

If you have suggestions for improvements or would like to contribute, please let me know. The most obvious extensions are to include data from ""real"" news sites and to address the bias in the current list. I'd be happy to include any contributions in future versions of the dataset.

This is a repository for an ongoing data collection project for fake news research at ASU. We describe and compare FakeNewsNet with other existing datasets in [Fake News Detection on Social Media: A Data Mining Perspective][1]. We also perform a detail analysis of FakeNewsNet dataset, and build a fake news detection model on this dataset in [Exploiting Tri-Relationship for Fake News Detection][2]

JSON version of this dataset is available in github [here][3].
The new version of this dataset described in [FakeNewNet][4] will be published soon or you can email authors for more info.

## News Content
It includes all the fake news articles, with the news content attributes as follows:

1. _source_: It indicates the author or publisher of the news article
2. _headline_: It refers to the short text that aims to catch the attention of readers and relates well to the major of the news topic.
3. _body_text_: It elaborates the details of news story. Usually there is a major claim which shaped the angle of the publisher and is specifically highlighted and elaborated upon.
4. _image_video_: It is an important part of body content of news article, which provides visual cues to frame the story.

## Social Context
It includes the social engagements of fake news articles from Twitter. We extract profiles, posts and social network information for all relevant users. 

1. _user_profile_: It includes a set of profile fields that describe the users' basic information
2. _user_content_: It collects the users' recent posts on Twitter
3. _user_followers_: It includes the follower list of the relevant users
4. _user_followees_: It includes list of users that are followed by relevant users

135,Fake-News-Dataset,Two fake news datasets covering seven different news domains. ,"## Introduction
This describes two fake news datasets covering seven different news domains. One of the datasets is collected by combining manual and crowdsourced annotation approaches (FakeNewsAMT), while the second is collected directly from the web (Celebrity).

## Data collection
The FakeNewsDatabase dataset contains news in six different domains: technology, education, business, sports, politics, and entertainment. The legitimate news included in the dataset were collected from a variety of mainstream news websites predominantly in the US such as the ABCNews, CNN, USAToday, NewYorkTimes, FoxNews, Bloomberg, and CNET among others. The fake news included in this dataset consist of fake versions of the legitimate news in the dataset, written using Mechanical Turk. More details on the data collection are provided in section 3 of the paper. 

The Celebrity dataset contain news about celebrities (actors, singers, socialites, and politicians). The legitimate news in the dataset were obtained from entertainment, fashion and style news sections in mainstream news websites and from entertainment magazines websites. The fake news were obtained from gossip websites such as Entertainment Weekly, People Magazine, RadarOnline, and other tabloid and entertainment-oriented publications. The news articles were collected in pairs, with one article being legitimate and the other fake (rumors and false reports). The articles were manually verified using gossip-checking sites such as ""GossipCop.com"", and also cross-referenced with information from other entertainment news sources on the web.

The data directory contains two fake news datasets:

- Celebrity
The fake and legitimate news are provided in two separate folders. The fake and legitimate labels are also provided as part of the filename.

- FakeNewsAMT
The fake and legitimate news are provided in two separate folders. Each folder contains 40 news from six different domains: technology, education, business, sports, politics, and entertainment. The file names indicate the news domain: business (biz), education (edu), entertainment (entmt), politics (polit), sports (sports) and technology (tech). The fake and legitimate labels are also provided as part of the filename.

136,News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection,High quality dataset for the task of Sarcasm Detection,"#Context

Past studies in Sarcasm Detection mostly make use of Twitter datasets collected using hashtag based supervision but such datasets are noisy in terms of labels and language. Furthermore, many tweets are replies to other tweets and detecting sarcasm in these requires the availability of contextual tweets.

To overcome the limitations related to noise in Twitter datasets, this **News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection** is collected from two news website. [*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) aims at producing sarcastic versions of current events and we collected all the headlines from News in Brief and News in Photos categories (which are sarcastic). We collect real (and non-sarcastic) news headlines from [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/).

This new dataset has following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets:

* Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embeddings.

* Furthermore, since the sole purpose of *TheOnion* is to publish sarcastic news, we get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets.

* Unlike tweets which are replies to other tweets, the news headlines we obtained are self-contained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements.

# Content
Each record consists of three attributes:

* ```is_sarcastic```: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0

* ```headline```: the headline of the news article

* ```article_link```: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data

# Further Details
General statistics of data, instructions on how to read the data in python, and basic exploratory analysis could be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection). A hybrid NN architecture trained on this dataset can be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/Sarcasm-Detection-using-NN).

# Inspiration

Can you identify sarcastic sentences? Can you distinguish between fake news and legitimate news?

# Reading the data
Following code snippet could be used to read the data:

import json

def parse_data(file):

    for l in open(file,'r'):

        yield json.loads(l)

    
data = list(parse_data('./Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset.json'))

138,WSDM - Fake News Classification,Identify the fake news.,"# Background

WSDM (pronounced ""wisdom"") is one of the premier conferences on web-inspired research involving search and data mining. [The 12th ACM International WSDM Conference][1] will take place in Melbourne, Australia during Feb. 11-15, 2019. 

This task is organized by ByteDance, the Platinum Level Sponsor of the conference. ByteDance is a global Internet technology company started from China. Our goal is to build a global content platform that enable people to enjoy various content in various forms. We inform, entertain, and inspire people across language, culture and geography.

One of the challenges which we are facing is to combat different types of fake news. Fake news here refers to all forms of false, inaccurate or misleading information, which now poses a big threat to human civilization.

At Bytedance, we have created a large-scale database to store existing fake news articles. Any new article must go through a test on the truthfulness of content before being published. We conduct matching between the new article and the articles in the database. Articles identified as containing fake news will be withdrawn after human verification. The accuracy and efficiency of the process, therefore, becomes crucial for us to make the platform safe, reliable, and healthy.

# About This Dataset

This dataset is released as the competition dataset of [Task: Fake News Classification][1] with the following task:

Given the title of a fake news article A and the title of a coming news article B,  participants are asked to classify B into one of the three categories.

- agreed: B talks about the same fake news as A
- disagreed: B refutes the fake news in A
- unrelated: B is unrelated to A

## File 
- **train.csv** - training data contains 320,767 news pairs in both Chinese and English. This file provides the only data you can use to finish the task. Using external data is not allowed.
- **test.csv** - testing data contains 80,126  news pairs in both Chinese and English. The approximately 25% of the testing data is set to be public and is used to calculate your accuracy shown on the leading board. The remaining 75% private data is used to calculate your final result of the competition.
- **sample_submission.csv** - sample answer to the testing data.


## Data fields
- **id** - the id of each news pair.
- **tid1** - the id of fake news title 1.
- **tid2** - the id of news title 2.
- **title1_zh** - the fake news title 1 in Chinese.
- **title2_zh** - the news title 2 in Chinese.
- **title1_en** - the fake news title 1 in English.
- **title2_en** - the news title 2 in English.
- **label** - indicates the relation between the news pair: agreed/disagreed/unrelated.

The English titles are machine translated from the related Chinese titles. This may help participants from all background to get better understanding of the datasets. Participants are highly recommended to use the Chinese version titles to finish the task.  

# Evaluation Metrics

We use **Weighted Categorization Accuracy** to evaluate your performance. Weighted categorization accuracy can be generally defined as:

$$ WeightedAccuracy(y, \hat{y}, \omega) = \frac{1}{n} \displaystyle{\sum_{i=1}^{n}} \frac{\omega_i(y_i=\hat{y}_i)}{\sum \omega_i} $$

where \\(y\\) are ground truths, \\(\hat{y}\\) are the predicted results, and \\(\omega_i\\) is the weight associated with the \\(i\\)th item in the dataset.

In our test set, we assign each testing item a weight according to its category. The weights of the three categories, agreed, disagreed and unrelated are \\(\frac{1}{15}\\), \\(\frac{1}{5}\\), \\(\frac{1}{16}\\), respectively. We set the weights in consideration of the imbalance of the data distribution to minimize the bias to your performance caused by the majority class (unrelated pairs accounts for approximately 70% of the dataset).

142,Russian Troll Tweets,"200,000 malicious-account tweets captured by NBC","### Context

As part of the House Intelligence Committee investigation into how Russia may have influenced the 2016 US Election, Twitter released the screen names of almost 3000 Twitter accounts believed to be connected to Russia’s Internet Research Agency, a company known for operating social media troll accounts. Twitter immediately suspended these accounts, deleting their data from Twitter.com and the Twitter API. A team at NBC News including Ben Popken and EJ Fox was able to reconstruct a dataset consisting of a subset of the deleted data for their investigation and were able to show how these troll accounts went on attack during key election moments. This dataset is the body of this open-sourced reconstruction.

For more background, read the NBC news article publicizing the release: [""Twitter deleted 200,000 Russian troll tweets. Read them here.""](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731)

### Content

This dataset contains two CSV files. `tweets.csv` includes details on individual tweets, while `users.csv` includes details on individual accounts.

To recreate a link to an individual tweet found in the dataset, replace `user_key` in `https://twitter.com/user_key/status/tweet_id` with the screen-name from the `user_key` field and `tweet_id` with the number in the `tweet_id` field.

Following the links will lead to a suspended page on Twitter. But some copies of the tweets as they originally appeared, including images, can be found by entering the links on web caches like `archive.org` and `archive.is`.

145,Who starts and who debunks rumors,Webpages cited by rumor trackers,"# Context 

[Emergent.info](http://www.emergent.info/) was a major rumor tracker, created by veteran journalist [Craig Silverman](https://twitter.com/CraigSilverman). It has been defunct for a while, but its well-structured format and well-documented content provides an opportunity for analyzing rumors on the web. 

[Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/) is one of the oldest rumors trackers on the web. Originally launched by Barbara and David Mikkelson, it is now run by a team of editors who investigate urban legends, myths, viral rumors and fake news. The investigators try to provide a detailed explanation for why they have chosen to confirm or debunk a rumor, often citing several web pages and other external sources. 

[Politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/) is a fact-checker that is focused on statements made by politicians and claims circulated by political campaigns, blogs and similar websites. Politifact's labels range from ""true,"" to ""pants on fire!""  

---

# Content

This dataset consists of three files. One file is a collection of all webpages cited in Emergent.info, and the second is a collection of webpages cited in Snopes.com, and the third is a similar collection from Politifact.com. The webpages were often cited because they had started a rumor, shared a rumor, or debunked a rumor. 

###Emergent.info
Emergent.info often provides a clean timeline of the rumor's propagation on the web, and identifies which page was for the rumor, which page was against it, and which page was simply observing it. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in this dataset.

![The image displays a sample post from Emergent.info and highlights the corresponding fields in emergent.csv.][1]

###Snopes.com
The structure of posts on **Snopes.com** is not as well-defined. Please refer to the image below to learn more about the fields in the Snopes dataset.

![This image displays a sample post from Snopes.com and highlights the corresponding fields in snopes.csv.][2]

###Politifact.com
Similar to Emergent.info, Politifact.com follows a well-structured format in reporting and documenting rumors. There is a sidebar on the right side of each page that lists all of the sources cited within the page. The top link is the likeliest to be the original source of the rumor. For this link, page_is_first_citation is set to true. 

![This image displays a sample post from Politifact.com and highlights the corresponding fields in politifact.csv.][3]

---

# Inspiration

I created this dataset in order to study domains that frequently start, propagate, or debunk rumors. By studying these domains and people who follow them, I hope to gain some insight into the dynamics of rumor propagation on the web, as well as social media. 

---

# Notes/Disclaimer

When using the Snopes dataset, please keep the following in mind: 

* In addition to debunking rumors, Snopes.com occasionally reports news and other types of content. This collection only includes data from ""[Fact Check](http://www.snopes.com/category/facts)"" posts on Snopes.
 
* Snopes.com was launched years ago. Some of the older posts on the website do not follow the current format of the site, therefore some of the fields might be missing.

* Snopes.com used to use a service named ""[DoNotLink.com](https://twitter.com/donotlink?lang=en)"" for citation purposes. That service is no longer active and as a result some of the links are missing from older posts on Snopes. 

* In addition, some of the shortened links would time-out prior to resolution, in which case they would not be added to the dataset. 

* Occasionally, a website that has been cited has not maliciously started a rumor. For instance, Andy Borowitz is a humorist who writes for *The New Yorker*. His satirical column is sometimes mistaken for real news; as a result, *The New Yorker* may be cited as a source of fake news on [Snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/trump-blasts-media-for-reporting-things-he-says/). This does not mean that *The New Yorker* is a fake news website.

When using the Politifact dataset, please keep the following in mind:

* The data included in this dataset are collected from the ""[truth-o-meter](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/)"" page of Politifact.com.

* Politifact often fact-checks statements made by politicians. Since this dataset is focused on websites, I have ignored all the posts in which the rumor was attributed to a person, a political party, a campaign, or an organization. Instead, I have only included rumors attributed explicitly to websites or blogs. 

---

# Useful Tips for Using the Snopes collection

As opposed to the Emergent collection where each page is flagged with whether it was for or against a rumor, no such information is available for the Snopes dataset. To avoid manually labeling the data, you may use the following heuristics to identify which page started a rumor:

* Webpages that are cited in the ""Examples"" section of a post are often ""observing"" the rumor, i.e. they have not started it, but they are repeating it. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_example.""

* Webpages that are cited in the ""Featured Image"" section of a post are often not related to the rumor. The editors on Snopes have simply extracted an image from those pages to embed in their posts. In the snopes.csv file, these webpages have been flagged as ""page_is_image_credit.""

* Webpages that are cited through a secondary service (such as [archive.is](http://archive.is/)) are likelier to be rumor-propagators. Editors do not link to them directly so that a record of their page is available, even if it is later deleted.

* If neither of these hints help, very often (but not always) the first link cited on the page (for which ""page_is_example"" and ""page_is_image_credit"" are false) is the link to a page that started the rumor. This link is identified by the ""page_is_first_citation"" field. Pages for which both ""page_is_first_citation"" and ""page_is_archived"" are true are very likely to be rumor propagators. 

* To identify satirical websites that are mistaken for real news, it's useful to inspect the way they are cited on Snopes. To demonstrate that a website contains satire or humor, Snopes writers often cite the ""about us"" page of the site. Therefore it's useful to  see which domains often contain a URI to their ""about"" page (e.g. ""http://politicops.com/about-us/"").

148,Fact-Checking Facebook Politics Pages,Hyperpartisan Facebook pages and misleading information during the 2016 election,"### Context

During the 2016 US presidential election, the phrase “fake news” found its way to the forefront in news articles, tweets, and fiery online debates the world over after misleading and untrue stories proliferated rapidly. [BuzzFeed News][1] analyzed over 1,000 stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages selected from the right, left, and mainstream media to determine the nature and popularity of false or misleading information they shared.
 
### Content

This dataset supports the original story [“Hyperpartisan Facebook Pages Are Publishing False And Misleading Information At An Alarming Rate”][2] published October 20th, 2016. Here are more details on the methodology used for collecting and labeling the dataset (reproduced from the story):
  
**More on Our Methodology and Data Limitations**

“Each of our raters was given a rotating selection of pages from each category on different days. In some cases, we found that pages would repost the same link or video within 24 hours, which caused Facebook to assign it the same URL. When this occurred, we did not log or rate the repeat post and instead kept the original date and rating. Each rater was given the same guide for how to review posts:
 
* “*Mostly True*: The post and any related link or image are based on factual information and portray it accurately. This lets them interpret the event/info in their own way, so long as they do not misrepresent events, numbers, quotes, reactions, etc., or make information up. This rating does not allow for unsupported speculation or claims.
 
* “*Mixture of True and False*: Some elements of the information are factually accurate, but some elements or claims are not. This rating should be used when speculation or unfounded claims are mixed with real events, numbers, quotes, etc., or when the headline of the link being shared makes a false claim but the text of the story is largely accurate. It should also only be used when the unsupported or false information is roughly equal to the accurate information in the post or link. Finally, use this rating for news articles that are based on unconfirmed information.    

* “*Mostly False*: Most or all of the information in the post or in the link being shared is inaccurate. This should also be used when the central claim being made is false.    
 
* “*No Factual Content*: This rating is used for posts that are pure opinion, comics, satire, or any other posts that do not make a factual claim. This is also the category to use for posts that are of the “Like this if you think...” variety.
 
“In gathering the Facebook engagement data, the API did not return results for some posts. It did not return reaction count data for two posts, and two posts also did not return comment count data. There were 70 posts for which the API did not return share count data. We also used CrowdTangle's API to check that we had entered all posts from all nine pages on the assigned days. In some cases, the API returned URLs that were no longer active. We were unable to rate these posts and are unsure if they were subsequently removed by the pages or if the URLs were returned in error.”

### Inspiration
 
Here are some ideas for exploring the hyperpartisan echo chambers on Facebook:
 
* How do left, mainstream, and right categories of Facebook pages differ in the stories they share?

* Which types of stories receive the most engagement from their Facebook followers? Are videos or links more effective for engagement?

* Can you replicate BuzzFeed’s findings that “the least accurate pages generated some of the highest numbers of shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook”?

150,Boatos de WhatsApp e outros do BoatosOrg (pt + es),1900 boatos (pt) + 130 rumores (es) desmentidos por boatos.org,"### Contexto

Boatos são compartilhados em milhares de grupos todos os dias no WhatsApp, enganando muitos brasileiros. Para tentar combater esses boatos, eu imaginei que possa ter algum padrão nesses textos, para tentar identificá-los automaticamente e combater esse problema usando Machine Learning.

Para isso, eu precisava de datos, então criei esse dataset fazendo scrapping de todos os boatos falsos dos sites [boatos.org](http://www.boatos.org/) e [hablillas.org](http://hablillas.org/), que estão nesses CSVs para que você possa explorar à vontade.

Se quiser saber mais sobre o que fiz com esses dados, dê uma olhada no projeto [Fake News Detector](https://fakenewsdetector.org/).

### Conteúdo

O dataset contém o texto do boato em si, o link desmentindo o boato e a data que ele foi dementido pelo boatos.org, ou pelo hablillas.org para os rumores em espanhol.

O código usado para fazer scrapping desses dados está no [repositório do github](https://github.com/fake-news-detector/scrappers).

### Ideias para explorar

- Existe algum padrão de escrita nos boatos?
- Boatos costumam ter mais emojis que conversas comuns?
- Quem são as pessoas que mais aparecem nos boatos? Dilma? Temer? Pabllo Vittar?
- Olhando as datas, estão surgindo boatos cada vez mais rápido?
- Podemos identificar e bloquear um boato no whatsapp antes que ele se espalhe?

151,Predict Pakistan Elections 2018,Help Us Predict the Next Winner,"### Context

Here comes the July 25th 2018 and Pakistan will see the 13th election (1954, 1962, 1970, 1977, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2002, 2008 and 2013) since independence. It’s middle of the week (Wednesday) with an expected temperature of 27-33 degree Celsius with almost no chances of rain anywhere in the country. 

We predict the historic voters’ turn out in this election of 57-61%. Historically the average turn out is 45% since 1977 (lowest 35% in 1997, highest 55% in 1977 and 53% in last elections). Pakistan ranked 164th out of 169 nations in voters’ turn out; Australia being the first with 94.5% turn out. 

Voters’ participation in the country is very diverse, historically Musakhel and Kohlu yield less than 25% whereas Layyah and Khanewal yield more than 60% and everything else is in between. Punjab has the highest and Balochistan has the lowest voters’ turnout.

The contest will bring 3,675 candidates for 272 national assembly seats, that is 13 candidates on average per seat. PTI has unleashed 244 candidates ([highest in number][1] by any political party). Islamabad will see [76 candidates][2] just for 3 seats fighting to rule the capital that guarantees the psychological edge. 

There a quite few interesting facts about these elections, for example we will see the highest number of Lotas (candidates who often change their party affiliation) ever. PTI believes to win the election no matter what may come while the survey pundits predicts the PML(N) [lead of at least 13%][3] over PTI. 

The history of elections and the charges of corruption, voters’ fraud, ghost votes, interferences by deep state or violence go hand by hand. There is (almost) no country in the world without the fear or accusations of such incidents in their elections. 
We are releasing the complete National Assembly Elections’ Results dataset for 2002, 2008 and 2013 elections in CSV files for public and calling all data scientists, international observers and journalists out there to help us achieve our inspirations. 

### Content

Three CSV files for complete election results for the national assembly of Pakistan for 2002, 2008 and 2013.
The file contains Seat, Constituency, Candidates Name, Party Affiliation, Votes, TotalValidVotes, TotalRejectedVotes, TotalVotes, TotalRegisteredVoters and Turnout variables for each seat.


### Acknowledgements

The dataset should be referenced as “Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, Sana Rasheed, Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Ilyas and Qazi Humayun, Pakistan Elections Complete Dataset (2002, 2008, 2013), Kaggle, July 7, 2018.”

### Inspiration
Here is the list of ideas we are working on and like you to help with. Please post your kernels and analysis 

1.	Map each NA constituency to a District. Get the list of Districts in Pakistan. So we will know how many constituencies we have in each district and which ones? Please update the dataset version on this page.

2.	Find and Convert the current 2018 candidates list to Excel sheet and upload here

3.	Find out total no of candidates in 2018 elections, from each party, from each province, total no of parties and Avg. no of candidates per seat

4.	Calculate the voter’s turn out in each NA. Highest, lowest etc. Make a historical timeframe so we would know how many people voted in each NA in 2002, 2008 and 2013

5.	Do analysis on invalid votes in each NA in all elections. Do we see any patterns here?

6.	Can we predict the effect of rain on voter’s turn out in a given constituency? 

7.	Find out how many NEW candidates we have this time who have never contested any elections before? How many in each party?

8.	Can we make District Profiles with good visuals and heat-maps of which party would be leading in which district?

9.	Can we color the map of Pakistan (as we do in the US with Red and Blue) for each district? We can have a color or PML(N), PTI, PPP and MMA (only four major parties to start with)

10.	Can we find out Swing Districts and the Confirmed Districts for major parties?

11.	Are there any external datasets that we can join with this dataset to do some analysis? Please post the links or update the datasets here

12.	Make the Candidates’ profile so we know his party position in each election and whether he lost or won the last election(s). You can  whatever values and information as you like

13.	Get the ***“Lota”*** Score for each candidate. So anyone with more than 2 would be a ***“Certified Lota”.*** These candidates are the ones who have changed their parties by x no of times, from independent to PPP, from PTI to PML etc.

14.	Get the “Confirmed Constituencies” where historically we have only one sided results. For example, PPP would always win from NA-XYZ or Zardari have never lost an election doesn’t matter where he ran from. Which party would definitely win which seats? 

15.	Get the list of “Swing Constituencies” which historically are as random as anybody’s guess. For example, NA-XYZ voted for PTI in 2002, then went to PPP in 2008, then to PMLN in 2013 and so on. Once we have this list we can go further down and talk in detail the margins of win/loss in previous elections, who are the candidates (their profiles, district profiles, voter turnout etc.) and even results of bi-elections. But it is very important to get this list in first place. This is where can apply some models to do predict which way it will sway

16.	Make the “Party Potential” list. For Example, PML(N) with all its candidates, profiles etc. has the potential  to win 86 seats, PTI 65, PPP 43 etc. Here we can predict which party would form the government in which province?

17.	Find out how many people voted so far in Pakistan in last 3 elections. Max, Min, Avg. Per Seat, Per Province?  Can we hypothesize that that avg. no of voters in Punjab per seat (who go out and vote) is double than the avg. no of voters in KPK? Or voter turnout in Bunner is less than 25% while in Chakwal It is more than 65%?

18.	Popular Vote winner. Even if PML(N) lose, can we say that it will fetch max no of votes from the country by vote count only? Or is it true for PPP or PTI?

19.	Find “Fake Candidates” the people who are running but have no chance to win. Like no past elections or political history. These are the one who will withdraw 24 hours before the elections

20.	Find the “Independents” who will go to the highest bidder after winning

21.	Find anything interesting you can on candidates. Like is it true if candidates’ name start from M or A, he has twice the chances of winning than the candidates whose names start with other letters?

22.	Surprise Me!
