       "  \"Ready to render PBR 3D model of a Czech hedgehog, created in Maya 2018.The Czech hedgehog is a static anti-tank obstacle defense made of metal angle beams or I-beams (that is, lengths with an L- or I-shaped cross section). The hedgehog is very effective in keeping light to medium tanks and vehicles from penetrating a line of defense; it maintains its function even when tipped over by a nearby explosion. Although Czech hedgehogs may provide some scant cover for infantry, infantry forces are generally much less effective against fortified defensive positions than mechanized units.ABOUT- This model was originally created to be used in modern render engines- High quality polygonal model built to accurate real-world scale- PBR textures- Game ready- Optimized, non-overlapping UVs- Optimized mesh for maximum texel density- Relative texture paths- Clean scene that opens without any errorsSPECIFICATIONS- This model was created using real-life reference and is modeled in a real-world scale using meters- The .mb/.ma scene contains 1 object with correct naming and pivots for easy-use/animation- Total faces - 1876- Total vertices - 1945- Correct smoothing groups, centered pivot at 0,0,0- 1 Group (CzechHedgehog_grp)- All parts can be seperated easily to make custom groups if needed- 2 Display layers - Mesh, cameras + lights- Contains some poles on flat surfaces, but does not affect the model's renders whatsoeverFILE FORMATS- .mb (maya, native)- .ma (maya, native)- .obj- .fbxRENDERS- All shown images are rendered using Marmoset ToolbagTEXTURES- All nescessary maps are included to make sure the model can render in any modern engine- 1x CzechHedgehog  PBR  4K 4096x2096 .png (Diffuse, Metallic, Roughness, AO, Normal, Glossiness, IOR, Reflection, MetallicSmoothness)Thank you for your support.The3DBadger\"],\n",

These are real world cuts (I am a gem cutter as well as a graphic/3D designer)if you design jewelry for real life, or the virtual worlds, these gemstones and materials are what you need to add real colored gemstones to your creations- NURBS Based Geometry in the Supplied Rhino Files (Rhino versions 5 & 6 included)Polygon Mesh Geometry in OBJ files  OBJ mesh geometry was created from the Rhino NURBS originals and utilize the least number of polygons necessary to generate the gemstone's facet shapes- 20 Custom VRay Next Gemstone Materials  includes an assorted grouping of 20 custom V-Ray gemstone materials from the following groups: quartz varieties (amethyst, citrine, rose de France, smokey quartz, praisolite, rock crystal, rose quartz), beryl varieties (aquamarine, emerald, morganite, green beryl, heliodore), topaz varieties (imperial pink, imperial orange, imperial red, imperial yellow, london blue, sky blue, swiss blue ), tourmaline varieties (indicolite, rubelite, green, paraiba), garnet varieties (pyrope, almandite, spessartite, demantoid), and cubic zirconia**- All of the materials included with this sample pack will work with any of the three custom cut virtual gemstonesNotes:- Scaling/resizing: ALWAYS USE UNIFORM SCALE when resizing a custom cut virtual gem  each virtual gemstone has been optically designed for a specific primary material and range of secondary materials  that optical performance only occurs when the facet angles are aligned correctly so to avoid loss of optical performance always use uniform scaleSize, Color and Optical Performance Guidelines:- Gemstone materials get their color primarily from the refraction fog color if you need to lighten or darken a custom cut virtual gemstone adjust the fog color and fog multiplier settings in the refraction section of the material (see the V-Ray Next manual for a complete description of how to make adjustments to the custom gemstone materials.- The same material will appear darker on larger stones, and lighter on smaller stones due to the amount of material the light rays have to travel through. If you have applied a material to a custom cut virtual gemstone and it appears too dark adjust the using a lighter colored version of the same gemstone.- In general, gemstones with a small number of facets, (the flat, highly-polished 'mirror' panels that cover the surface of the gemstone), are cut at smaller sizes, and gemstones with a high number of facets are typically cut larger (in the real world the smallest working size for facets is around 1 mm anything smaller is hard to do by hand. So if you want your gemstones to look realistic in your 3D creations, keep the relative sizes correct.\"],\n",

       "  \"Wall Carving 1An intricate unique stone wall carving from Thailand. Since the texture process came out substandard this one is for free. Please see 'Wall Carving 2' for better results.Photoscan InformationPhotoscanning offers the ability to capture the world around us and bring it into the 3D. Each model comes in a variety of different resolutions for easy management and use throughout many programs. Due to the nature of photoscanning, the models are not perfect, but our intention is to provide a large range of items in high detail captured from the real world for use in your creations whether it be architectural visualisation, game development or more.Please note that there are generally five resolutions (decimation ratios) for each model, where 'Blender' [.blend] and WaveFront [.obj] are the native formats. Other file types available include -- BLENDER 2.78- OBJ- DAE- FBX- 3DS MAX [2017 + 2014]- STL- PLY- SKETCHUP V8All ZIP files contain:Highest - 1,000,000 facesHigh - 500,000 facesMedium - 100,000 facesLow - 50,000 facesLowest - 10,000 facesNOTESFor 3DSMAX, the models contained within the files (2014 & 2017) need their textures re-linked to the texture images contained within the MAX.ZIP/OBJ folder. Also please note that the title of the item online may differ from the file names when downloading.Blender Cycles [v2.78] file only contains the 1000K resolution mesh, please download the Blender [v2.71] version for all mesh LODs.The rendered imagery for this model has been captured from the 'Highest' model within Blender Cycles. Depending on the model complexity the above resolutions may differ, i.e. there may be need for a +1000K item which will be stated in this description when required.The goal of providing these models and assets for you is use within your own game development, level design, film animatics, storyboarding, architectural design, historic study, educational use and much more. Spacescan aims to create and provide a vast library of assets that cannot be easily made digitally or 'within the box' so to speak.Best Regards,Jamie.\"],\n",

       "  \"This is an older looking Medieval or Victorian style kitchen.This model is primarily metal. A concrete slab under the whole thing and a brick chimney are the only two exceptions. There is a metallic mask to separate the metal and the dielectric parts of the model in the material.  The kitchen includes a large basin on the left to deep-fry or boil food in. The brick chimney channels the oil vapor upwards and out of the house(wouldn't want the oil fumes to make a fireball in the house). On the right end are several shelves that a fire can be built under to keep food warm or to bake breads and/or cakes in. The main part of the kitchen is a big surface which can be heated and then used to cook food on.The mesh is very clean and quite low resolution if you want to use it in a game.Although this model is pretty cool and will stand on its own in a scene, it does have a slight Medieval or Victorian style and works well with the other Victorian assets I have made. I will be uploading the full pack soon!The textures have been uploaded separately in a .zip from the rest of the 3D model files. They (the textures) come in only one size, 2K resolution. I made this model for usage in games or as a background detail for a big scene so the textures are not super hi-res.This model includes: Color map Normal map Displacement map Specular map Metallic maskThe separate maps were generated using Photoshop.If you like the model, rate it.
