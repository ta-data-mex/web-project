# Project: Web Scraping

## Overview
I came up with the idea of a handy data frame with the main trails in Mexico, because I am a mountain lover. So, I used the [Alltrails](https://www.alltrails.com/es/mexico) page to extract the information.

All details are shown in the jupyter notebook, as well as the further support I will requiare from the TAs ;)
